IxD Pattern Library
===================

A simple pattern library to help teach the principles of HTML and CSS to first year Interaction Design Students. This is a developing project and will most likely adapt as it evolves.

The structure of Objects – Components – Patterns – Pages has been recreated from [Building Beautiful UIs](https://bbuis.org/index.html) (BBUIs) by kind permission of [Chris Murphy](https://mrmurphy.com). 

First off we will be covering the basic principles of our pattern library by laying down the foundations with objects. 

### Objects
Objects are foundations of our online content – this includes head content, a barebones page structure, typographic structure, colour and a responsive framework.

The idea is to choose the objects appropriate for each the project thereby saving time recreating them from scratch.
