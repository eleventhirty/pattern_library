IxD Pattern Library
===================

A simple pattern library to help teach the principles of HTML and CSS to first year [Interaction Design](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/courses/202021/interaction-design-19390) Students. This is a living project and will change over time.

The structure of – Objects – Components – Patterns – Pages – has been recreated from [Building Beautiful UIs](https://bbuis.org/index.html) (BBUIs) by kind permission of [Chris Murphy](https://mrmurphy.com). 

Students should create their own pattern library, I am not expecting to see a clone of my version. To develop a fuller understanding of what a pattern library actualy is you shouyld read [Paul Boag's](https://boagworld.com/boagworks) excellent post *[How to create a pattern library and why you should bother](https://boagworld.com/design/pattern-library)*



First off we will be covering the basic principles of our pattern library by laying down the foundations with objects. 



### Objects
Objects are foundations of our online content – this includes head content, a barebones page structure, typographic structure, colour and a responsive framework.

The idea is to choose the objects appropriate for each the project thereby saving time recreating them from scratch.
